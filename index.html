            This first project was designed using HTML, CSS, and JS. I was very interested in CSS at this point and wanted to play around with a lot of different styling.

            This second project was designed using Node, Mongoose and JSX. I wanted to create a Full Stack Application geared towards the Fashion Industry that allows users to create, read, update and delete a blog post. They also have the ability to upload a picture using a URL.

        <h1>
            Restaurant Finder
        </h1>
        <p>
            This third project was a collaborative project. My team and I spent a week building out both the Frontend and Backend of this application to produce one that allowed users to sign up, login, and add their favorite restaurants and bars to their profile. This project was created using the MERN stack, Mongoose, Express, React, Node JS and uses React Bootsrap for styling.

            This fourth project was inspired by an artist friend of mine. It was the first project done using Ruby on Rails as the Backend and React as the Frontend. With such a short deadline (24hrs), I was able to have users see the featured Artists and submit their artwork and biography to become a feature Artist themselves. There are some technical issues due to timing.

            StyleHub
        </h1>
        <p>
            My final project, StyleHub uses Ruby on Rails for the API and React for the Frontend. Although it doesn't quite work yet, this project has Ruby authentication on the backend and allows users to request a stylist for their special day!
