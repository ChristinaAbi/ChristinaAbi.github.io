                Biography:
                </h2>
                <p>
                Christina Louis-Charles was introduced to Technology by her cousin at age 7, dabbling in both Hardware
                and Software. Deciding that she was nervous to take the Technology route so early, she decided to go
                into Education. She graduated from Skidmore College with a Bachelors Degree in Education. Shortly after
                graduating, she entered the Real Estate World as an Administrative Assistant, where she realized that
                her true passion was being a part of the Fashion World. So combining her young passion for Technology
                and her inate passion for Fashion, Christina decided to further immerse herself in Technology, focusing
                on Software Engineering. Christina's eagerness for learning paired with her ability to work on a team
                and take criticism demonstrates a well-rounded team player and a want to better herself in Technology.

                </h1>
                <p>
                    This first project was designed using HTML, CSS, and JS. I was very interested in CSS at this point
                    and wanted to play around with a lot of different styling.

                <p>
                    This second project was designed using Node, Mongoose and JSX. I wanted to create a Full Stack
                    Application geared towards the Fashion Industry that allows users to create, read, update and delete
                    a blog post. They also have the ability to upload a picture using a URL.

                </h1>
                <p>
                    This third project was a collaborative project. My team and I spent a week building out both the
                    Frontend and Backend of this application to produce one that allowed users to sign up, login, and
                    add their favorite restaurants and bars to their profile. This project was created using the MERN
                    stack, Mongoose, Express, React, Node JS and uses React Bootsrap for styling.

                <p>
                    This fourth project was inspired by an artist friend of mine. It was the first project done using
                    Ruby on Rails as the Backend and React as the Frontend. With such a short deadline (24hrs), I was
                    able to have users see the featured Artists and submit their artwork and biography to become a
                    feature Artist themselves. There are some technical issues due to timing, such as the backend only
                    being deployed.

                <p>
                    My final project, StyleHub uses Ruby on Rails for the API and React for the Frontend. Although it
                    doesn't quite work yet, this project has Ruby authentication on the backend and allows users to
                    request a stylist for their special day!
